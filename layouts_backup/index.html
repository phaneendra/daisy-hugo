<!-- This is a unique template to define the home page of website. The homepage, similar to other list pages in Hugo, accepts content and front matter from an _index.md file. This file should live at the root of your content folder (i.e., content/_index.md). You can then add body copy and metadata to your homepage the way you would any other content file.-->
